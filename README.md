**Police Department Analytical Dashboard**
**Problem Statement :**

The lack of comprehensive data-driven insights hampers effective police performance assessments and resource allocation optimization. It becomes challenging for superior officers to supervise the execution of duties and responsibilities by police stations, Police Sub-Inspectors (PSIs), Police Inspectors (PIs), and supervisory activities by Assistant Commissioners of Police (ACPs) or Deputy Superintendents of Police (DySPs).

**Solution Overview :**

Our solution aims to address these challenges by creating an *analytical dashboard* that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) across different units and locations within the police department. This dashboard will provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making and resource optimization. Key features of our solution include:

- *Dashboard Interface*: A user-friendly dashboard interface with tables, bars, and charts representing various themes and sub-themes of police activities.

- *Hierarchical Data Aggregation*: Data aggregation at different levels of the police hierarchy, starting from individual police stations, aggregating to Police Inspectors (PIs), and further to ACPs/DySPs. This allows for a comprehensive view of work output and performance at each level.

- *Automatic Data Update*: Integration with different data sources such as PoliceIT, IRAD, etc., to automatically update the dashboard with real-time data.

- *Progress Tracking*: Capability to track progress updates for different work items, enabling supervisors to monitor the status of tasks effectively.

- *Automated Alerts*: Automated alerts for non-completion of work items based on user-defined rules, ensuring timely intervention and action.

- *Manpower Mapping*: Provision for mapping manpower to work items through a weekly duty roster/chart, enabling efficient resource allocation.

- *Advanced Data Analysis*: Incorporation of advanced algorithms to analyze officer behavior by aggregating real-time data from social media and communication channels. This ensures adherence to departmental protocols and ethical standards.

- *Visualizations and Maps*: Provision of various visualizations and maps to visualize data for every district and its police stations, facilitating better decision-making and planning.
